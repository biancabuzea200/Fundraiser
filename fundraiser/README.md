## What are we building? - Birthday Funder

It’s your friend's birthday, and you know they’ve been dreaming of a trip to Japan for a while. You decide to help them make that dream a reality by organizing a birthday fund for the trip. All friends contribute some ETH as a gift, with a minimum contribution of $50.

We'll use the Chronicle ETH/USD price feed to calculate the current price of ETH in USD.
